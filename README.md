## Smart Classroom Frontend

This is the backend implementation for the Smart Classroom project, developed 
as part of our Software Engineering coursework.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create a unified platform that brings together all stakeholders in an educational institution, including:

<ul>
    <li>Students</li>
    <li>Teachers</li>
    <li>Administrators</li>
    <li>Parents</li>
</ul>

By integrating various functionalities, we aim to enhance communication, 
streamline academic processes, and improve the overall learning experience.
This backend is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, serving as 
the foundation for a modern, technology-driven classroom environment.
